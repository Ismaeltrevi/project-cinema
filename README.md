## Objectives

### Answer the fallowing questions:

1. Is there any connection between the top 20 most profitable movies of all times?  
2. Does higher budgets reflect in higher profits?  
3. What are the top 10 genres with the most movies launched since 1990?  
4. What groups of genres bring the highest box office revenue and ROI?  
5. What genres bring the highest box office revenue and ROI?


## Approach
1. Understand the business problem
	- What is considered "currently" in the industry?
2. Understand the market
	- How do movie studios make money?

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### Out of the top 20 most profitable movies:
- 18 them are part of a franchise of movies
- 13 of them are continuations of previous movies
- 5 of them are the first movie of a franchise
- 2 of them haven't had a continuation yet, but they are underway
- Only Beauty and the Best and Titanic aren't part of a franchise yet.

Correlation between the data:
Higher budget and higher box office are positively correlated. However, it is not garantee that higher budget will bring higher revenue. It will depend on the quality and reception of the final product.
