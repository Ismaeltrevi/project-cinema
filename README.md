# Project Cinema
Data Scientist:
- Ismael Araujo


## Repository and Data

This repository contains data collection, cleaning, and analyses of data sets of movies released from 1990 to 2020.

It was used data sets provided by Flatiron School and data sets downloaded from IMDb.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will analyze the recent cinematographic industry and what factors can influence the sucess of a movie and/or movie studios. We will walk through the most profitable movies and genres and identify patterns.The main objective is to identify trends and correlations to create recommendations to companies interested in entering the movies industry. 

## Objectives

### Answer the fallowing questions:

1. Is there any connection between the top 20 most profitable movies of all times?  
2. Does higher budgets reflect in higher profits?  
3. What are the top 10 genres with the most movies launched since 1990?  
4. What groups of genres bring the highest box office revenue and ROI?  
5. What genres bring the highest box office revenue and ROI?

## Structure

- PNG -- contains images with graphics linked in README
- project-cinema.ipynb -- it's the notebook with data wragling, data cleaning, data analyses, and visualization.


## Approach
1. Understand the business problem
	- What is considered "currently" in the industry?
2. Understand the market
	- How do movie studios make money?
	- How much percent to the get out of the revenue?
3. Understand what aspects can help a movie to become profitable?
	- What type of movies make the most money?
	- What genres have the best and worst return per dollar invested?
	- Are there any pattern in successful movies?

## Conclusions and Recommendations

Out of the top 20 most profitable movies:
18 them are part of a franchise of movies
13 of them are continuations of previous movies
5 of them are the first movie of a franchise
2 of them haven't had a continuation yet, but they are underway
Only Beauty and the Best and Titanic aren't part of a franchise yet.

Correlation between the data:
Higher budget and higher box office are positively correlated. However, it is not garantee that higher budget will bring higher revenue. It will depend on the quality and reception of the final product.

Higher budget and higher profits have a positive moderate correlation
Budget and box office have a strong positive correlation
Duration and average vote have a moderate correlation
Budget and duration have a moderate correlation

All that remains in Phase 1 is to put our newfound data science skills to use with a large project! This project will take an entire week to complete.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they don’t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry.
Your team is charged with exploring what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org

It is up to you to decide what data from this to use and how to use it. If you want to make this more challenging, you can scrape websites or make API calls to get additional data. If you are feeling overwhelmed or behind (e.g. struggled with the Phase 1 Code Challenge), we recommend you use only the following data files:

* imdb.title.basics
* imdb.title.ratings
* bom.movie_gross

## Deliverables

There are three deliverables for this project:

1. A **GitHub repository**
2. A **Jupyter Notebook**
3. A **non-technical presentation**

Keep in mind that the audience for these deliverables is not only your teacher, but also potential employers. Employers will look at your project deliverables to evaluate multiple skills, including coding, modeling, communication, and domain knowledge. You will want to polish these as much as you can, both during the course and afterwards.

We provide a few resources to help you understand what makes for good deliverables.
- The rubric associated with this assignment
- [A template for you to use, with an example for reference][].

### GitHub Repository

Your GitHub repository is the public-facing version of your project that your instructors and potential employers will see - make it as accessible as you can. At a minimum, it should contain all your project files and a README.md file that summarizes your project and helps visitors navigate the repository.

### Jupyter Notebook

Your Jupyter Notebook is the primary source of information about your analysis. At a minimum, it should contain or import all of the code used in your project and walk the reader through your project from start to finish. You may choose to use multiple Jupyter Notebooks in your project, but you should have one that provides a full project overview as a point of entry for visitors.

### Non-Technical Presentation

Your non-technical presentation is your opportunity to communicate clearly and concisely about your project and it's real-world relevance. The target audience should be people with limited technical knowledge who may be interested in leveraging your project. For Phase 1, these would be Microsoft executives interested in making decisions about movie development. We recommend using Google Slides, PowerPoint or Keynote to create your presentation slides.

## Getting Started

Please start by reviewing this document. If you have any questions, please ask your instructor ASAP.

We recommend you check out [the Phase 1 Project Templates and Examples repo](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-project-template) and use the MVP template for your project.

Alternatively, you can fork [the Phase 1 Project Repository][], clone it locally, and work in the `student.ipynb` file. Make sure to also add and commit a PDF of your presentation to your repository with a file name of `presentation.pdf`.

## Project Submission and Review

Review [the Phase Project Submission and Review guidance][] to learn how to submit your project and how it will be reviewed. Your project must pass review for you to progress to the next Phase.

## Summary

This project will give you a valuable opportunity to develop your data science skills using real-world data. The end-of-phase projects are a critical part of the program because they give you a chance to bring together all the skills you've learned, apply them to realistic projects for a business stakeholder, practice communication skills, and get feedback to help you improve. You've got this!

## Tips

Ask for help from your peers or instructors early and often.
