## Project Overview

In this project, we will analyze the recent cinematographic industry and what factors can influence the success of a movie and/or movie studios. We will walk through the most profitable films and genres and identify patterns. The main objective is to identify trends and correlations to create recommendations to companies interested in entering the movie industry.

## Objectives

### Answer the fallowing questions:

1. Is there any connection between the top 20 most profitable movies of all time?
2. Do higher budgets reflect in higher profits?
3. What are the top 10 genres with the most movies launched since 1990?
4. What groups of genres bring the highest box office revenue and ROI?
5. What genres bring the highest box office revenue and ROI?



## Approach
1. Understand the business problem
- What is considered "currently" in the industry?
Understand the market
- How do movie studios make money?
- How much percent to the get out of the revenue?
Understand what aspects can help a movie to become profitable?
- What type of movies makes the most money?
- What genres have the best and worst returns per dollar invested?
- Are there any patterns in successful movies?

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### Out of the top 20 most profitable movies:
- 18 of them are part of a franchise of movies
- 13 of them are continuations of previous movies
- 5 of them are the first movie of a franchise
- 2 of them haven't had a continuation yet, but they are underway
- Only Beauty and the Beast and Titanic aren't part of a franchise yet.

Correlation between the data: 
Higher budget and higher box office are positively correlated. However, it is not guaranteed that a higher budget will bring higher revenue. It will depend on the quality and reception of the final product.
