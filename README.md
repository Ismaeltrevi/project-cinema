# Phase 1 Final Project

## Introduction

In this lesson, we review the guidelines for the Phase 1 Final Project.

## Objectives

You will be able to:

* Start your Phase 1 Final Project
* Check that your project meets the requirements
* Submit your project materials in Canvas

## Project Overview

You've made it all the way through the first phase of this course - take a minute to celebrate your awesomeness!

All that remains in Phase 1 is to put our newfound data science skills to use with a final project! This project will take an entire week to complete. 

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry.
Your team is charged with exploring what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org

It is up to you to decide what data from this to use and how to use it. If you want to make this more challenging, you can scrape websites or make API calls to get additional data. If you are feeling overwhelmed or behind (e.g. struggled with the Phase 1 Code Challenge), we recommend you use only the following data files:

* imdb.title.basics
* imdb.title.ratings
* bom.movie_gross

## Deliverables

There are four deliverables for this project:

1. A **GitHub repository**
2. A **Jupyter Notebook**
3. A **Non-technical presentation**
4. A **Blog post**

Keep in mind that the audience for these deliverables is not only your teacher, but also potential employers. Employers will look at your project deliverables to evaluate multiple skills, including coding, modeling, communication, and domain knowledge. You will want to polish these as much as you can, both during the course and afterwards.

We provide a few resources to help you understand what makes for good deliverables. 
- The rubric associated with this assignment 
- [A template for you to use, with an example for reference][]. 

### GitHub Repository

Your GitHub repository is the public-facing version of your project that your instructors and potential employers will see - make it as accessible as you can. At a minimum, it should contain all your project files and a README.md file that summarizes your project and helps visitors navigate the repository. 

### Jupyter Notebook

Your Jupyter Notebook is the primary source of information about your analysis. At a minimum, it should contain or import all of the code used in your project and walk the reader through your project from start to finish. You may choose to use multiple Jupyter Notebooks in your project, but you should have one that provides a full project overview as a point of entry for visitors.

### Non-Technical Presentation

Your non-technical presentation is your opportunity to communicate clearly and concisely about your project and it's real-world relevance. The target audience should be people with limited technical knowledge who may be interested in leveraging your project. For Phase 1, these would be Microsoft executives interested in making decisions about movie development. We recommend using Google Slides, PowerPoint or Keynote to create your presentation.

### Blog Post

Your blog post is your opportunity to communicate to a wider audience about your project or what you've learned while doing it. The target audience is your peers in the broader data science community. Refer to the [blogging guidelines][] for blog requirements and ideas.

## Submitting your Project

To submit your project, you will need to create and upload PDF versions of the four project deliverables. 

### Presentation PDF Creation

1. Save or export your presentation as a PDF from the program you created it in. 
2. Give it a short descriptive file name (e.g. `presentation.pdf`).
3. Include a copy of the PDF in your GitHub repository.

### GitHub Repository PDF Creation

1. Navigate to the root directory of your project repository on GitHub, using your browser (we recommend Google Chrome).
2. Save the webpage as a PDF using the browser's Print functionality ([Google Chrome Save to PDF instructions])
3. Give it a short descriptive file name (e.g. `github.pdf`).

### Jupyter Notebook & Blog PDF Creation

1. Open your Notebook/blog post in your browser (we recommend Google Chrome).
2. Save the webpage as a PDF using the browser's Print functionality ([Google Chrome Save to PDF instructions])
3. Give it a short descriptive file name (e.g. `blog.pdf`).

### PDF Submission in Canvas

You will need to submit all four PDF files as a single submission:

1. Click "Submit Assignment" at the top of this page.
2. In the "File Upload" box, click "Choose File" button to upload a single file.
3. Click the "Add Another File" link to upload an additional file.
4. Repeat Step 3 two times to upload two more files. After this is done, all four files should be uploaded.
5. Hit the blue "Submit Assignment" button.

## Project Review

You have until the end of the week to present and submit your project. All students must complete all project deliverables and submit them by the end of the week to proceed to the next phase. The process for reviewing your project will depend on whether you passed the code challenge.

### Passed Code Challenge: Check for Completion

If you passed the code challenge, your teacher will review your project to ensure that you have submitted all of the required project deliverables. While you may find this assignment's rubric helpful for guiding your project, it will not be used to evaluate your submission.

### Did Not Pass Code Challenge: Rubric Scoring

If you did not pass the code challenge, your teacher will use the rubric below to grade your submission. You can earn 0, 1, or 2 points on each element. You will receive a final 1-5 score based on the percentage of available points you earn. A score of 3 or higher is considered passing.

*  0% to 29% = 1
* 30% to 49% = 2
* 50% to 69% = 3
* 70% to 89% = 4
* 90% to 100% = 5

Your teacher will grade your submission and give you feedback sometime during the week after you submit.

## Summary

This project will give you a valuable opportunity to develop your data science skills using real-world data. The end-of-phase projects are a critical part of the program because they give you a chance to bring together all the skills you've learned, apply them to realistic projects for a business stakeholder, practice communication skills, and get feedback to help you improve. You've got this!

## Tips

Ask for help from your peers or instructors early and often.
